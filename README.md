Python project to assist in stock picking and portfolio management.

The objective is to compare multiple years of a specified month on a selected stock ticker.
For example, selecting the SPY ticker for the month of September will display the SPY price change across the years for that month.

This is to help see which months are more volatile than the others to assist in when to purchase stocks.
